## hi

I've been learning programming using the laser-dac library to create some simple games. This repo serves as the base for the interactivity using a modified version of the Simulator to work with mouse and keyboard inputs.

**Note** I do not have a laser to test this. Do you? Let's get in touch.

# usage

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm i`
3. Run `npm run build`
4. Run `npm run dev`
5. Visit http://localhost:8080 in your fav browser

You should be seeing something like this:

Click the mouse and wonder at the ball changing colours at random. Awe at the random transformation of the bounds when you press the spacebar.
